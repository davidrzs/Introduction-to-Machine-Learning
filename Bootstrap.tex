\section*{Bootstrap}
For $B$ rounds $b_i$ collect rand. points and compute $\hat{f}_b$. Compute risk of $\hat{f}_b$ as $r_b(x,y) = y-\hat{f}_b(x)$. Then compute average risk $R_{b_i}$, then over all $B$.

The empirical distribution of $r_b$ can be used to build empirical quantiles - statistical testing.
